# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

This repository contains a customer churn prediction model built using Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression. The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using a service) based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `customer_churn.csv`. It contains various features related to customer demographics, account information, and service usage, along with a target variable indicating whether the customer has churned.

## Project Structure

- `customer_churn.csv`: The dataset used for training and evaluating the models.
- `churn_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project description and setup instructions.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following packages installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
